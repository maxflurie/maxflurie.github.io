# Recent Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects that utilize varied statistical and analytical approaches. You will see a range of files: some are fairly simply tutorials for instructional purposes, while others are more complex implementations of machine learning algorithms, statistical models, NLP pipelines, etc used in published projects.  

**For R files:** You will see files that end with ".rmd" and ".html". ".rmd" is an R Markdown file. You can copy and paste the raw code right into your own R Markdown. ".html" is an R Markdown converted to be accesible in a web browser. It is better for instructional purposes (and I usually include all the code you would need for your own projects.) I recommend ".html" for learning purposes. Download the file to your Git/Git Desktop and it will open in a webpage.  

**For Python Files:** All Python projects are currenty in the form of Jupyter Notebooks (".ipynb"). If you click on the project in the repository, the full notebook should load. You can also clone the file for your own projects. 

**For Tableau Vizs:** Static .png files for Tableau can be found in this repository (e.g., title_TableauViz.png). You can view interactive Viz's using the following link with an active Tableau Public profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/max.flurie#!/
