# Recent Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects that utilize varied statistical and analytical approaches. Some files include tutorial-based instruction for implementation while others provide only demonstrations.  

**For R files:** You will see files that end with ".rmd" and ".html". ".rmd" is an R Markdown file. You can copy and paste the raw code right into your own R Markdown. ".html" is an R Markdown converted to be accesible in a web browser. It is better for instructional purposes (and I usually include all the code you would need for your own projects.) I recommend ".html" for learning purposes. Download the file to your Git/Git Desktop and it will open in a webpage.  

**For Python Files:** All Python projects are currenty in the form of Jupyter Notebooks (".ipynb"). If you click on the project in the repository, the full notebook should load. You can also clone the file for your own projects.
