# Recent Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects that utilize varied statistical and analytical approaches. Some files include tutorial-based instruction for implementation while others provide only demonstrations.  

**For R files:** You will see files that end with ".rmd" and ".html". ".rmd" is an R Markdown file. You can copy and paste the raw code right into your own R Markdown. ".html" is an R Markdown converted to be accesible in a web browser. It is better for instructional purposes (and I usually include all the syntax you would need for your own projects.) I recommend .html for learning purposes. Download the file to your Git Desktop and it will open in a webpage.
